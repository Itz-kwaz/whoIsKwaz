Create a signup / login activity for the old application you made.

It should take email address and password and other details and save it during signup. 

Validate the users details on login.

The details can be stored with whatever medium you want. Shared preference is preferred for you so you don't get confused.

Take one of the information that the user enters from the login screen like the email and display on the mainActivity ( The old portfolio screen ) 

Make alternative layouts for the login/signup in landscape mode.
